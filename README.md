# Advanced CSS Portfolio

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a functional website that will act as my online portfolio as I progress through the coding boot camp. As I start looking for work nearing the end of this boot camp, his website will allow potential employers to review samples of my work and assess my skills. 

Starting from scratch and using HTML and CSS coding, the webpage consists of:

- A header detailing my name and links to the different sections within the portfolio webpage. 
- An 'About Me' section with a photo of myself, and a brief block of text.
- Titled images of the different applications I have created which also act as links to the corresponding applications (The first   application being larger in size).
- A 'Contact Me' section with my phone number, email address, and links to my Github and Linkedin pages.
- A responsive layout that adapts to the user's viewpoint when the page is resized on various screens and devices.

The code to create this project consists of:

- Semantic HTML elements 
- HTML classes and anchors 
- CSS variables 
- Flex box
- CSS Background positions- 
- Media queries and responses 

The deployed website can be viewed through this link - https://bondt1.github.io/Challenge2-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio/

## Usage

The website informs the viewer of information about me, previous applications that I have created, and my contact details.

When the links in the header are clicked, the UI wil scroll down to the corresponding sections. The titled images within the 'Work' section will reduce in opacity when the mouse is hovering over them. Additionally when clicked, the images links will take you to the corresponding applications. The GitHub and Linkedin links in the 'Contact Me' section wil also take the user to my personal pages on the corresponding platforms when clicked. 

The website layout will adapt to different display sizes on various devices to ensure the information is always displayed in a clear and efficient manner.
